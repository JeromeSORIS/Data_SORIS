## Purpose
Gathering open source data in relation with ground space activities: open source data acquisition, data standardization, data filtering and data visualization.

The kml file reprensents the CURRENT SITUATION of ACTIVE ALERTS and SPACE LAUNCHES.

More preciselly, SORIS is an automatic OSINT collection of :
- NOTAM (air) : active and future NOTAM
- NAVIGATION WARNING (sea) : active and future warning
- SPACE LAUNCHES : recent and future launches

Data from SORIS are available in the 'geojson' and the 'kml' file (daily update).

***Update 12NOV23:***

It's also a collection of previous NOTAM avaiable in the 'Activite SOL - CHN.kml' for a better assessment of a future launch :
